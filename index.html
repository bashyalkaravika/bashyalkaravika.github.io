            <p>Hello, This is me Karavika. This is my second practicing website
                using Html and css. I hope I will also use java script in near futute
                and make this website more useful and good. Even though my son wakes up in every 15 
                minutes of his sleep I am trying to do my best and learn something in whatever
                time I get. Being mother it is not so easy as I have to do lot of things from
                cooking, dishes, cleaning and taking care of little one throughout a day. Today,
                our boy said his first word 'Baba' and I loved hearing that again and again. He is 
                such a loving son. I feel so blessed to have him and his father in my life. They 
                are my backbone.</p>
